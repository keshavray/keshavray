## Hi there 👋

🚀 Keshav Ray | Cloud & DevOps Engineer | Future Kubestronaut 🌍

With 10+ years of experience in IT and 7-8 years specializing in Cloud & DevOps, I thrive on automating infrastructure, optimizing cloud environments, and building scalable solutions. I have deep expertise in Azure, AWS, Kubernetes (K8s), CI/CD, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with tools like Terraform.

Passionate about container orchestration, automation, and cloud security, I’m always exploring the latest in ML Ops and Kubernetes to push the boundaries of modern DevOps. Whether it's streamlining deployments, enhancing observability, or securing cloud-native applications, I love solving complex problems efficiently.

🔹 Key Skills: Azure | AWS | Kubernetes | Docker | Terraform | CI/CD | DevOps | ML Ops (Learning)

Always open to new challenges, collaborations, and knowledge-sharing! 🚀 Let’s build something amazing together.
